# Player vs Player Tic Tac Toe

## Instruction

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. Player 1 starts with word **"Shut"**, Player 2 is **"Up"**. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
